# hyphperframe/h2-hpack: HTTP/2 Header Encoding for PHP 

This library contains the HTTP/2 header encoding (HPACK) code used in the [hyphper project](https://github.com/hyphper). It provides a pure-PHP codebase that is capable of encoding/decoding HPACK headers.

This library is used directly by hyphper to provide HTTP/2 header encoding/decoding logic.

This library is based on the [Python Hyper "hpack"](https://github.com/python-hyper/hpack) project.
